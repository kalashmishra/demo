                    A personal loan is one of the choicest go-to options for
                    individuals with immediate requirement of funds. The main

                    customisation, easy application process, and instant fund
                    disbursement. In addition, the personal loan eligibility
                    criteria are quite lenient which ensures you can get assured

                  <h2>Factors Influencing Personal Loan Eligibility</h2>
                  <p>
                    Wondering which factors can have a prominent effect on the
                    personal loan eligibility criteria? Here are some of the
                    primary ones that have a notable effect on your personal
                    credit eligibility:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span>Credit Score:</span> Personal loan, being an
                      unsecured credit type demands a higher CIBIL score. This
                      assures creditors that you are a trustworthy borrower and
                      they can expect you to pay your monthly instalments on
                      time. Since no collateral is involved, it is vital to
                      maintain a score of 700 and above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Age bar:</span> As you have already seen that most
                      of the lenders have set the minimum age bar to 21 years,
                      it becomes mandatory to have reached it to get approval.
                      Also, you must ensure that your maximum age at the time
                      you complete loan repayment should be 58 or as the lender
                      specifies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Minimum income:</span> If a borrower has a high
                      income, lenders are sure that you will have sufficient
                      cash to pay an increased monthly instalment. So, you can
                      easily go for a sumptuous credit amount. On the contrary,
                      if your monthly salary is less or below the minimum income
                      bar, there are chances of rejection of credit application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Repayment capacity:</span> While reviewing your
                      personal loan application, lenders check the liabilities
                      that you already have. If you have multiple credits to
                      repay at the time of loan application, lenders realise
                      that it can pose a financial burden to repay another
                      credit. So, they might reject your application or lower
                      the allowed credit amount.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Business or working experience:</span> Several
                      financial institutions have set a minimum work experience
                      of two years or more as an eligibility criterion for
                      salaried individuals. Also, some lenders demand a business
                      vintage of 3 years, which self-employed individuals need
                      to fulfil to stand eligible for credit approval.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                      <span>Nationality:</span> Go for a co-applicant or
                      guarantor: In case you have a low CIBIL score and want a
                      personal loan urgently, you can request your friends or
                      family members with a good CIBIL score to be your
                      co-applicant or even a guarantor. This can lead to a
                      prompt improvement in your personal loan eligibility and
                      approval of credit application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Refrain from frequent job switches:</span> Wondering
                      why frequent job switches hamper your loan eligibility? If
                      you keep changing your job again and again, lenders are
                      not able to estimate your monthly income and view you as a
                      high-risk borrower. Hence, it would be prudent to avoid
                      changing your job randomly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Maintain a credit score above 750:</span> A credit
                      score above 750 makes lenders believe that you are an
                      ardent financial planner having good experience in
                      repaying your credits. However, if you have a lower score,
                      try to take some effective steps to improve it immediately
                      and fulfil the loan eligibility criteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Do not for multiple loan applications:</span> If you
                      already have more than one credit to repay, it can pose a
                      financial burden to pay EMIs for all. Also, at times it
                      can make you miss out on the monthly instalment date,
                      leading to lowering of your CIBIL score. Thus, it would be
                      prudent to apply for credit only when needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Create sources of additional income:</span> Creating
                      additional sources of income allows you to earn extra
                      every month. This eases the payment of monthly instalments
                      on time. In view of this, creditors will see you as a more
                      eligible candidate and approve your loan immediately after
                      application.
