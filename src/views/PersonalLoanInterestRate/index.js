                  <h2>Types Of Interest Rates On Personal Loan</h2>
                  <p>
                    Usually, financial institutions offer two types of personal
                    loan interest rates. You must know the difference between
                    both the types as they can affect the affordability of the
                    credit instrument significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {" "}
                    Here are the two types of interest rates applicable to
                    personal loans:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span> Fixed interest rates</span> This type of interest
                      rate remains fixed throughout the loan repayment tenure.
                      This means that if the lender charges 5% interest on a
                      personal loan at the start of the loan term, it will
                      remain unchanged despite the fluctuations in the market.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Variable interest rates</span> This interest type
                      gets affected by the changes in the market situations. If
                      you are a prospective borrower, you must choose the
                      interest type carefully to avoid financial burden in the
                      long run.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>Aspects That Affect Personal Loan Interest Rates</h2>
                  <p>
                    In order to secure the lowest personal loan interest rate,
                    you must know the factors on which the rates depend upon:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span>Income:</span> If you have a high monthly income,
                      banks and NBFCs will charge a lower interest rate. This is
                      because lenders consider borrowers with a higher monthly
                      income as more reliable than those with low income. A
                      person with a low monthly income has a higher chance of
                      facing a financial crisis and defaulting on a credit
                      instrument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Repayment History:</span> Your repayment history
                      allows the lending intuition to determine your ability to
                      repay the loan on time. Banks will charge a lower interest
                      rate on personal loans if you have a good repayment
                      history with no records of defaulting.{" "}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Lender and Borrower Relationship: </span> If you
                      have built and maintained a good relationship with a
                      financial institution, you are more likely to get a lower
                      interest rate. Due to your relationship with the lender,
                      they will consider you as a low-risk applicant and
                      sanction a personal loan with a lower interest rate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span> Debt-to-Income Ratio: </span> The amount of ongoing
                      debts you have compared to your current monthly income is
                      known as the debt-to-income ratio. If you have a high
                      debt-to-income ratio, you will be charged a higher
                      interest rate on a personal loan. This is because a person
                      with a considerable amount of debt has a higher chance of
                      defaulting on any credit line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Credit Score and Report: </span> If you have a
                      decent credit score you will be offered the best personal
                      loan interest rates. This is because, a good credit
                      report, free from defaults and missed payments, indicates
                      excellent financial management.
                    </li>

                    In order to get hold of the lowest interest rates, it is
                    essential to do thorough market research. Check all the
                    offers extended by different lending partners and settle
                    down for the one that offers the most flexible terms.

                  <p>
                    In this regard, you can use a personal loan EMI calculator
                    to compare different lenders. This online tool works on
                    three variables (principal, rate of interest and tenure) and
                    displays the EMI for the values you feed in.

                    Your repayment capacity is among the first things that the
                    bank or NBFC will check while sanctioning your loan
                    application. In case you have a high debt-to-income ratio,
                    you will be charged a higher rate of interest. This is
                    because the risks of defaulting increase for such
                    applications.

                    However, if you plan and repay a certain amount of your
                    current debt, you can negotiate with the lender for offering
                    a lower interest rate. You can start off with this by
                    preparing a list of all the debts you are serving currently
                    and noting down their respective rates of interest. Then,
                    begin repaying the debt with the highest interest rates.
                    Consequently, your overall outstanding debt will also
                    reduce.

                    In case repaying the current outstanding debt is not a
                    viable option, you can opt for the balance transfer
                    facility. This facility allows you to transfer the remaining
                    personal loan amount to a new lender offering a lower
                    interest rate or more flexible terms.
